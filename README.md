# Better Quake

</div>

BetterQuake is an extension made for [Gandi IDE](https://getgandi.com/) to fully allow the use of custom shaders.
This extension is built with an [extension scaffholding](https://github.com/FurryR/scratch-ext) by FurryR. Huge thanks to him :3

## Current Issues with the extension

1. Incompatible with `Gandi Quake`.
2. Incompatible with `Clipping & Blending`.

A way to make `Clipping & Blending` compatible is already figured out and will be implemented in the future. `Gandi Quake` however we have no idea.
